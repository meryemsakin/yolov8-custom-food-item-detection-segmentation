## Metrics
![Accuracy](https://github.com/meryemsakin/yolov8-custom-segmentation/blob/main/r7.png)

## Model Performance
The performance of our model is evaluated with various metrics. mAP50 and mAP50-95 metrics assess the accuracy of our model's detection results. High mAP values indicate a more accurate model.

In our latest training output, the overall mAP50 value was determined as 0.942 and the mAP50-95 value as 0.937. This indicates that our model detects and segments objects with a high degree of accuracy in general.

When we evaluate the performance of our model for each food item separately, we see that the mAP50 and mAP50-95 values are quite high for most items. Especially for jam, pasta, and rice, these values are specified as 0.995, indicating that the model detects and segments these items with a very high level of accuracy.
